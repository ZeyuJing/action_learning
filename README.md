# Action_learning
This is ZJ's 2021 winter rotation project on action learning.

Navigation learning is thought to consist of three phases: trial-and-error, action learning, sequence learning & planning. This project propses a solution for the second phase, the action learning, using simple associative/hebbian learning rules. Effectively the model builds a lookup table over time so that the animals no longer have to perform trial-and-errors. A crucial part of the model is the Foldiak network, which is adapted to form sparse representation of the states of the model, each of which has a unique action associated to it.

Run main.py with your own parameters and graphs.
